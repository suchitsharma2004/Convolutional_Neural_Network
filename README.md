# Convolutional_Neural_Network
Here I've made a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) . This  model can differentiate between a cat and a dog. 
I wont be able to upload the dataset this time because it contains a sample of 10000 items.
The steps I've used for creating this model are:
a) convolutional operation
b) pooling
c) added second convolutional layer
d) flattening
e)full conection
